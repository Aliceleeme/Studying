  * Bootstrap simulation
    * parametric and the non-parametric bootstrap 
    * purpose: estimate some characteristics of the sampling distribution
    * The idea behind the bootstrap is that the sample is an estimate of the population, so an estimate of the sampling distribution can be obtained by drawing many samples (with replacement) from the observed sample, compute the statistic in each new sample.

  * Monte Carlo simulation
    * it refers to repeatedly creating random data in some way, do something to that random data, and collect some results. 
    * This strategy could be used to estimate some quantity, like in the bootstrap, but also to theoretically investigate some general characteristic of an estimator which is hard to derive analytically.
